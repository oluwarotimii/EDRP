 Staff Onboarding & School Join Code Feature
This is for a school management system where each school is a separate workspace, and admins manage staff onboarding via time-limited join codes.

✅ 1. School Registration + Auto-Generated Join Code
Endpoint: POST /schools
Purpose: Register a school and create its admin

🔻 Request Body:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "school_name": "Victory High School",
  "admin": {
    "name": "Mrs. Tayo",
    "email": "tayo@victory.edu",
    "password": "StrongPass123"
  }
}
🛠️ Backend Logic:
Create a new school record

Generate a unique 5-digit join code (e.g., 72391)

Set code_expires_at = now + 3 days

Create the admin user and link to the school

Return the join code with the school ID

🔑 2. Join a School (for Staff/Teachers Only)
Endpoint: POST /join-school
Purpose: Allow teachers or staff to self-register into a school using the school’s join code

🔻 Request Body:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "join_code": "72391",
  "name": "Mr. Kayode",
  "email": "kayode@victory.edu",
  "password": "StrongPassword"
}
🛠️ Backend Logic:
Validate the join code:

Ensure it exists

Ensure it hasn’t expired (code_expires_at > now)

Create the user:

role = staff

status = pending

school_id = matched school

Respond: “Registration successful, pending admin approval.”

✅ 3. Admin Approves or Rejects Pending Users
Endpoint: GET /users/pending
Purpose: Allow admin to view users with status = pending in their school

Endpoint: PUT /users/{user_id}/approve
Request Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "action": "approve"  // OR "reject"
}
🛠️ Logic:
Admin must belong to the same school_id

Update status field of user:

"active" if approved

"rejected" if denied

🔁 4. Join Code Regeneration
Endpoint: POST /schools/{school_id}/regenerate-code
Purpose: Allow admin to manually generate a new join code anytime.

🛠️ Logic:
Generate new unique 5-digit code

Set new code_expires_at = now + 3 days

Replace previous code

Return new code to admin

🔄 5. Automatic Code Expiry & Replacement
The join code is only valid for 3 days

After expiration, any attempt to join the school with the code should fail with a message like:

css
Copy
Edit
"Join code expired. Ask the admin to generate a new one."
Admins can regenerate codes any time, whether or not the previous one expired. The new code replaces the old one and starts a new 3-day validity window.

🔐 Role & Access Control Summary
Role	Can register school	Can approve staff	Can join via code
Admin	✅	✅	❌
Staff	❌	❌	✅

💡 Example Use Case Flow
Admin registers a school → receives join code 72391.

Within 3 days, a teacher joins using that code → status: pending.

Admin views pending list and approves the teacher.

After 3 days, the join code expires.

Admin regenerates a new code (18844) to invite more staff.
