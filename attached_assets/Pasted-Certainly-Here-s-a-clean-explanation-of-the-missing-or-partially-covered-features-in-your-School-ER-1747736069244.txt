Certainly! Here's a clean explanation of the missing or partially covered features in your School ERP system — **without using Firebase or third-party notification platforms like OneSignal**. Instead, we'll keep everything within your own backend ecosystem and database.

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown (Self-Hosted, No Firebase/OneSignal)

---

### 👪 **Parent Portal Summary**

**⚠️ Partially covered**

#### ✅ What You Have:

* Link/unlink parent to student
* View parents of a student

#### ❌ What's Missing:

* A dashboard-like API for a parent to view all their children’s academic and fee information.

#### ✅ Why It’s Needed:

Parents should see their children's:

* Attendance
* Fee balance
* Results or performance summary

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
GET /api/parents/{parent_id}/children
GET /api/parents/{parent_id}/summary
```

#### 🧾 Example response:

```json
{
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Tomi Ade",
      "class": "JSS2",
      "attendance": "92%",
      "fee_balance": 15000,
      "last_term_average": 78
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🗂️ **Custom Student Fields**

**❌ Not Covered**

#### ✅ Why It’s Needed:

Schools often need to record extra information such as:

* Medical conditions
* Guardian occupation
* Religion or language spoken
* Emergency contacts

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
POST /api/students/{student_id}/custom-fields
GET /api/students/{student_id}/custom-fields
PUT /api/students/{student_id}/custom-fields/{field_key}
DELETE /api/students/{student_id}/custom-fields/{field_key}
```

#### 💡 Example field:

```json
{
  "field_key": "medical_history",
  "field_value": "Asthma"
}
```

You can store this in a `student_custom_fields` table:

| id | student\_id | field\_key           | field\_value |
| -- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 1  | 101         | medical\_history     | Asthma       |
| 2  | 101         | guardian\_occupation | Trader       |

### 🧠 **AI Analytics / Performance Insights**

**❌ Optional but Valuable**

#### ✅ Why It’s Needed:

To help teachers, parents, and admins track:

* Students with poor attendance
* Subjects students struggle with
* Performance trends

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
GET /api/analytics/student/{student_id}
GET /api/analytics/class/{class_id}
```

#### 💡 Example Output:

```json
{
  "average_score": 68.5,
  "improvement_areas": ["Mathematics", "Biology"],
  "attendance_rate": "83%",
  "performance_status": "Needs improvement"
}
```

🧠 You can process this with backend logic using your own data — no AI engine required.

### 🧾 **Invoice Generation / PDF Exports**

**❌ Not Implemented**

#### ✅ Why It’s Needed:

Parents often request printable:

* Fee invoices
* Academic reports
* Payment receipts

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
GET /api/fees/{fee_id}/invoice
GET /api/reports/student/{student_id}/term/{term_id}/pdf
```

#### 💡 Backend Implementation:

Use a PDF library (e.g., [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/), [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/), or Python `fpdf`) to generate PDFs from HTML templates.

Return:

```http
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="invoice.pdf"
```

---

### 📢 **Announcements / Notifications (Internal)**

**❌ Not Implemented**

#### ✅ Why It’s Needed:

Schools need to broadcast:

* Events
* Emergency closures
* Exam timetables

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
POST /api/announcements
GET /api/announcements
GET /api/announcements/{target_type}/{target_id}  # class, department, user
```

#### 💡 Example Payload:

```json
{
  "title": "PTA Meeting",
  "message": "All parents should attend the meeting on Friday at 9AM.",
  "audience_type": "class",
  "audience_id": "JSS3A"
}
```

You can save these in a `notifications` or `announcements` table and query based on role or class.

---

### 📱 **Push-like Notifications (Without Firebase)**

**❌ Not Implemented**

#### ✅ What You Can Do Instead:

* Use **in-app notifications**:

  * When a parent logs in, show them new alerts
* Save notifications in a `notifications` table
* Mark notifications as `read/unread`

#### 📌 Suggested Routes:

```http
POST /api/notifications
GET /api/notifications/user/{user_id}
PUT /api/notifications/{id}/mark-read
```

#### 💡 Example Notification:

```json
{
  "user_id": 201,
  "title": "Payment Reminder",
  "message": "Your child has an unpaid balance of ₦12,000.",
  "is_read": false
}
```

📱 Your mobile app can **poll** this endpoint every few minutes or check on login for new alerts.
